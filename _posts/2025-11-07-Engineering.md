Are you an engineering student looking to apply your technical skills in a hands-on research environment? The <b>LAMP Lab</b> at Mizzou is inviting students with interests in <b>device design, programming, and system testing</b> to join our interdisciplinary team and collaborate with us on developing innovative tools for psychology research.

We’ve already started building our own custom systems — including a <b>liquid-delivery device</b> based on Arduino architecture that interfaces with psychology and neuroscience-specific software. It’s been a powerful tool, but there’s room to grow — from increasing its delivery capacity and long-term stability to making it more user-friendly and reliable for repeated research use.

Now, we’re looking for <b>engineering partners</b> who want to help us refine existing designs and prototype new ones. Future projects include creating an <b>olfactory stimulus device</b>, developing methods to measure and verify precise stimulus timing, and building <b>response collection systems</b> such as proximity and posture detectors or analog input devices.

These systems are essential for studying <b>how people respond to tastes, smells, movements,</b> and other sensory cues — allowing us to ask complex psychological questions about perception, motivation, and behavior with exacting precision and control. Some projects will even involve unique technical challenges, like ensuring devices are MRI-compatible, safe, and durable enough for repeated use in human research.

This is a great opportunity to gain real-world experience in prototype development, hardware/software integration, and human-subject research applications, while contributing to the technology that powers behavioral science.

<b>For the right candidate and project fit, paid opportunities may be available.</b>

If you’re excited by the idea of building devices that help us understand how the brain responds to the world, we’d love to hear from you! <b>Email mulamplab@missouri.edu with subject line "Engineering" to learn more about how to get involved.
