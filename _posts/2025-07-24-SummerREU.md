Lainie Mueller (MU-ARTSS) did a fantastic job presenting the research poster "Exploring the Effect of Personal and Family History of Substance Misuse on Appetitive Conditioning and its Neural-Behavioral Correlates" at the 2025 Summer Undergraduate Research and Creative Achievements Forum. With the support of lab mate River Stone (SREP), they conducted a research project where they collected psychophysiological (EEG+EMG+GSR) and behavioral data over the summer. The event also showcased the exciting research being conducted by undergraduates (both visiting students and MU undergraduates) in a wide variety of fields at Mizzou this summer.
