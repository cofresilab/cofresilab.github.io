Looking forward to 48th Annual RSA Scientific Meeting/ISBRA Congress, June 21-25, 2025 in New Orleans, LA, USA. Lab members Devon Terry & Camila Gutierrez will each be presenting a poster and sharing initial findings from the Sips and Shapes study (the og!)

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Exploration of Behavioral and Neural Responses to Visual Cues Experimentally Paired with Intra-Oral Alcohol Receipt in the Human Laboratory. <em> Devon Terry, Sandie Keerstock, Roberto Cofresi.</em> </p>


<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Reduced Sleep Hours and Increased Alcohol Cravings in Young Adults. <em>Maria Camila Gutierrez, Sandie Keerstock, Roberto Cofresi.</em> </p>


The Sips and Shapes study will also be discussed in a Symposia chaired by Dr. Roberto Cofresi "Alcohol's Incentive Salience: Cue Reactivity & Associative Memory Studies Across Species". The Symposia will bring together scientists and scholars working on affective and motivational features of alcohol memories, whether their work is with human subjects or non-human animal models, in order to foster crosstalk on the understanding of the neural mechanisms of alcoholâ€™s incentive salience.
