Looking forward to 48th Annual RSA Scientific Meeting/ISBRA Congress, June 21-25, 2025 in New Orleans, LA, USA. Lab members Devon Terry & Camila Gutierrez will each be presenting a poster and sharing initial findings from the Sips and Shapes study (the OG!)

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>Exploration of Behavioral and Neural Responses to Visual Cues Experimentally Paired with Intra-Oral Alcohol Receipt in the Human Laboratory.</b> <em> Devon Terry, Sandie Keerstock, Roberto Cofresi.</em> </p>


<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><b>Reduced Sleep Hours and Increased Alcohol Cravings in Young Adults.</b><em>Maria Camila Gutierrez, Sandie Keerstock, Roberto Cofresi.</em> </p>


The Sips and Shapes study will also be discussed in a Symposia chaired by Dr. Roberto Cofresi <b> "Alcohol's Incentive Salience: Cue Reactivity & Associative Memory Studies Across Species".</b> The Symposia will bring together scientists and scholars working on affective and motivational features of alcohol memories, whether their work is with human subjects or non-human animal models, in order to foster crosstalk on the understanding of the neural mechanisms of alcoholâ€™s incentive salience.
