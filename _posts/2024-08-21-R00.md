After successful completion of the K99 phase of his NIH Pathway to Independence Award, Dr. Cofresí received the R00 phase of the award to continue research on the Pavlovian conditioning model of individual differences in risk for alcohol cue incentive salience sensitization.[NIH/NIAAA K99/R00-AA029169 PI Cofresí](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/2zvIv60jqkGINlnyK9uyIA/project-details/11089117) 


The R00 phase will take place at the University of Missouri, and involve 4 research studies in the family of the Sips and Shapes Study. Be on the lookout for recruitment of research participants in the coming months!  

This exciting news also means that the research team in our lab will grow as we onboard a research coordinator for the R00 studies.
