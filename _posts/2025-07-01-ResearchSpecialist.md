### Congratulations to Devon, and Welcome to Kayla!
Devon Terry, our current research coordinator for the Sips and Shapes Study, will be starting the Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program at the University at Buffalo in Fall 2025! Devon has been an integral part of our team and helped us develop the Sips and Shapes Study and the lab spirit. While we’ll miss her greatly, we’re incredibly proud of her and can’t wait to see all that she’ll accomplish in this next chapter.

We’re happy to welcome Kayla Drifka to continue the mission as research coordinator. Kayla holds a bachelor's degree in Biopsychology, Cognition, & Neuroscience from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. She brings significant research experience in reward-related behaviors, real-time fMRI, and addiction science through her independent honors thesis. We're thrilled to have her join the team and continue moving the project forward!

Please join us in wishing Devon all the best and giving a warm welcome to Kayla!
