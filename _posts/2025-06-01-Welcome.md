#### Welcome to the lab, Julián!

We are thrilled to share that Julián Aponte Zabala, B.A. is joining the graduate program in Clinical Psychology at the University of Missouri in Fall 2025. Julián is joining the LAMP Lab and will begin his training with us in Summer 2025. Julián's scientific interests lie at an intersection between clinical psychology and cognitive neuroscience. He has an impressive record of science and service as an undergraduate scholar, including contributing to a NSF-funded research project with his undergraduate mentor, Dr. Yamil Ortiz, at the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras. We are looking forward to working with Julián and contributing to his training as a clinical psychologist specializing in addictive behaviors and alcohol/drug use-related problems.
