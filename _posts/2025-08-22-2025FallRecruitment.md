Fall 2025 is here! Full-time research coordinator Kayla Drifka, first year graduate student Julian Aponte Zabala, and junior research assistant Noah Schnarre went to several events on Mizzou campus to meet undergraduate students and tell them about the LAMP lab's research! Thank you to everyone who stopped by. Welcome (back) to Mizzou, Tigers!
