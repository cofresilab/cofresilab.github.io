## We are thrilled to welcome Devon Terry as the newest member of our lab! 

Devon is the Research Coordinator for Sips and Shapes (R00AA029169 PI: Cofresi). 

Devon holds dual B.A. degrees in Psychology and Anthropology from the University of Missouri, graduating Magna Cum Laude. 

In her previous role as a Research Coordinator at the Health Neuroscience Center at the University of Missouri's Department of Psychiatry, she coordinated NIH-funded studies on smoking cessation, investigating the neural mechanisms mediating addiction. In this role, she oversaw clinical trials, managed a research team, and supervised the collection of complex data including MRI, behavioral tasks, and biological specimens.

Previously, Devon worked as a Research Assistant in the Social Cognitive and Addiction Neuroscience Lab, where she collected EEG data, and administered clinical interviews for another NIH/NIAAA-funded study. As a McNair Scholar, she completed a thesis on depression and alcohol-drinking coping motives, integrating clinical interview data with ecological momentary assessment techniques.

Her unique training history and experience means Sips and Shapes is in good hands! We look forward to incorporating her insights into the upcoming Sips and Shapes studies and watching her grow as an active member of our lab and the broader addiction training group in the department.
