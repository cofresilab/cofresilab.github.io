## Cuetopia: Neurocognitive Mechanisms of Cue Learning in Adults. Research Study at the University of Missouri. MU Institutional Review Board (IRB) Project #2127874

Principal investigator: Dr. Roberto Cofresi, Department of Psychological Sciences. Contact: cofresir@missouri.edu

## Summary
We are seeking research participants for a study looking at how adult brains learn and remember new cues. Adults <b>aged 18 to 65 who reside in Boone or adjacent counties</b> and who can safely undergo a brain activity recording may be eligible. The study consists of a single lab visit to [MU Campus (Marx Building)](https://mulamplab.org/directions.html) where you will complete computer-based tasks and consume small amounts of water or fruit juice while your brain activity is recorded. Compensation available. Your participation is voluntary. This means you do not have to participate in the new study if you do not want to do so. Nothing will happen should you decide that you do not want to participate.  


## Purpose of the study
The purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of how various personal and situational factors affect learning and memory functions in our everyday lives. Findings from this study also will inform the scientific approach (e.g., selection of specific memory training/testing tasks or behavioral or psychophysiological measures, consideration of specific personal factors) proposed by Dr. Cofresi in his broader research on understanding of factors that might put people at risk for developing problems with alcohol or other drugs, or that might protect people from developing such problems. 


## How to participate
Complete the eligibility screener so that the research team can determine if you meet the study eligibility criteria.

## How do I know if I am eligible?
Eligible participants will be contacted by the research team via email/text/phone call (depending on your indicated preference). 

## Enrolled participants will be asked to:
- Complete computer-based tasks in which you will be viewing colorful shapes on a computer screen and consuming water and/or fruit juice (â‰¤8-oz total). During the tasks, your brain and muscle activity will be recorded.
- Multiple times during the visit: complete questionnaires relevant to the research (e.g. current emotional state and craving, taste of liquid, rate the appeal of various colored shapes).
- Complete a survey packet asking about general demographic information as well as other relevant information such as sleep duration, time of last meal, time of most recent physical exercise, and your recent and current alcohol and drug use.
- The duration of the study may vary depending on the tasks to be completed (between 1.5 and 3 hours). The research team will specify the expected duration for your lab visit at the time of scheduling.

## Compensation:
You will be compensated in cash at the end of the lab visit. The hourly compensation rate is $20 per hour. For example, you will earn $30 for a 1.5 hour-visit. The duration of the study may vary depending on the tasks to be completed (between 1.5 and 3 hours). The research team will specify the expected duration for your lab visit at the time of scheduling. 


## What if I have questions about the study?
You should contact the research team!
