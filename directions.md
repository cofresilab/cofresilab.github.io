Our lab is located in the [Melvin H. Marx Building](https://map.missouri.edu/?bldg=37011), off Mizzou’s main campus. You may want to either drive your personal vehicle, have a friend drop you off, or use Mizzou’s free campus shuttle services. Tiger Line is the university’s shuttle service throughout campus, provided at no extra charge to members of the university community in partnership with the City of Columbia.

### Parking

For research participants, there are 2 designated parking spots right in front of the building as well as 2 parking spots in the lot immediately south of the building. The spots are designated "RESTRICTED: IMAGING CENTER CLIENT PARKING", and are specifically intended for your use, so feel free to park in whichever spot is available. 


### Bus

If using the Tiger Line, the MU Reactor Loop (403) makes a loop between the bus shelter near the MU Reactor and the MU Student Center on Rollins St. You can find more information about the Tiger Line service at [gocomotransit.com/tiger-line](https://www.gocomotransit.com/tiger-line/)

Unfortunately, there is no shuttle that runs between the bus stop and our lab, and it is about a ten-minute walk. The map below depicts the most straightforward path. Note that you will need to walk through several parking lots. Please take caution and pay attention to vehicle traffic.

Below is a photo of the bus stop. If you are walking to our lab from here, you can take the stairs behind the Life Sciences Building.

<span class="image small"><img src="/assets/images/LifeScienceBldg2.png" alt="Life Science Bldg" width="400"/></span>

These stairs lead to a pathway out to the Red Cross parking lot. Please note that there are multiple parking lots to cross.

Keep crossing the lots until you make it to the Melvin H. Marx Building. This is our lab.
