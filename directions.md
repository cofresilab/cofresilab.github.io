Our lab is located in the [Melvin H. Marx Building](https://map.missouri.edu/?bldg=37011), off Mizzou’s main campus. You may want to either drive your personal vehicle, have a friend drop you off, or use Mizzou’s free campus shuttle services. Tiger Line is the university’s shuttle service throughout campus, provided at no extra charge to members of the university community in partnership with the City of Columbia.

### Parking

For research participants, there are 2 designated parking spots right in front of the building as well as 2 parking spots in the lot immediately south of the building. The spots are designated "RESTRICTED: IMAGING CENTER CLIENT PARKING", and are specifically intended for your use, so feel free to park in whichever spot is available. 


### Bus: MU Reactor Loop

The Tiger Line MU Reactor Loop (403) makes a loop between the bus shelter near the MU Reactor and the MU Student Center on Rollins St. It runs Monday – Friday, 6 a.m. – 8 p.m. at 10 or 20 minutes intervals. You can find more information about the Tiger Line service at [https://parking.missouri.edu/tiger-line-shuttle/](https://parking.missouri.edu/tiger-line-shuttle/). It's about a ten-minute walk between the bus stop and our lab. The map below depicts the most straightforward path. Note that you will need to walk through several parking lots. Please take caution and pay attention to vehicle traffic.

From the bus stop: you can take the stairs behind the Life Sciences Building. These stairs lead to a pathway out to the Red Cross parking lot. Please note that there are multiple parking lots to cross. Keep crossing the lots until you make it to the Melvin H. Marx Building. This is our lab.
